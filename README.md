##Data & Product Project Portfolio
This repository serves as a portfolio of projects demonstrating my skills in SQL, Python, and Machine Learning. The projects are designed to showcase my ability to tackle real-world business problems and derive actionable insights from data.

Each project in this repository is a step in my preparation for roles in the data and product fields. They focus on key competencies such as:

Data Analysis & Manipulation: Using SQL to query and transform data, and Python for in-depth analysis and data cleaning.

Problem-Solving: Applying structured thinking to break down complex problems and develop data-driven solutions.

Machine Learning Fundamentals: Building and evaluating models to predict outcomes and uncover patterns.

Product Thinking: Connecting data insights to product strategy and business outcomes.

Feel free to explore the projects and the code within. Each project includes a clear description of the problem, the methodology used, and the insights gained.
